# Tools

> Alternative titles: Technology Stack, Software Central

Just as painters and sculptors see their tools as extensions of
themselves, I find that the same applies to the tools software engineers
use to create software. Here are the programming languages, libraries,
services, and other tools I use and prefer when building software.

My current set up for launching new projects is composed of:

- React and typescirpt on the front end, deployed to `now`
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) server deployed to [render](https://render.com)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io) bindings, data layer, and hosted database to access and manage data.

I've chosen this tech stack after a fairly exhaustive exploration of the alternatives for each component,
and selected each component for a variety of reason. This document documents the reasoning behind each of
these decisions.

Moreover, it is important to note that my particular interest is
prototyping web applications, and my choice of tools is tailored to be
conducive to that interest.

## Front End

---

I particularly enjoy front-end web development because it allows me to
operate simultaneously as a developer, designer, and product manager.

### ⭐️ [React](https://reactjs.org)

React is great framework to learn just because of it's enormous
popularity. However, I've found that once you get through the horrific
uphil battle of learning how to <i>think in react</i>, it's built-in
composability makes constructing complex single-page applications an
absolute delight.

⭐️ [<code>create-react-app</code>](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

My go-to production-ready scaffolding tool for react projects. The zero configuration set up is invaluable, and I avoid `ejecting` the app whenever possible.
Use `npx create-react-app <app-name>` for action; plus `--typescript` if you want type-safe action.

Other Tools: I've used [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) sparingly at hackathons.
Less experience with [Angular](https://angular.io/).

### ⭐️ [Next](https://nextjs.org)

Another zero-configuration tool built by the [ZEIT](https://zeit.co) team for server-rendered react applications. Works like a charm with [Now](https://zeit.co/now).

## ORMs

---

### ⭐️ [Prisma](https://prisma.io)

Next-generation ORM and database-as-a-service with astonishingly pleasant data modeling, migrations, and management. Works with node and typescript, and a few other frameworks. Highly recommend following the Node tutotrial at [How To GraphQL](https://howtographql.com) to get started.

### [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.org)

Solid choice for prototyping side-projects on top of MongoDB

### [SQLalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)

The default ORM to use with flask and python. Works as expected.

### Django

Raved about by friends whom identify as pythonistas. I've only tinkered with it.

### Raw SQL queries

Used surprisingly often in production by large tech companies. Seems inefficient and too error prone for my likes.
