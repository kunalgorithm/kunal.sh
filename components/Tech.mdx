# Technology stack

Just as painters and sculptors see their tools as extensions of
themselves, I find that the same applies to the tools software engineers
use to create software. Here are the programming languages, libraries,
services, and other tools I use and prefer when building software.

Moreover, it is important to note that my particular interest is
prototyping web applications, and my choice of tools is tailored to be
conducive to that interest. This is not intended to be a prescriptive
guide for other engineers and is blatantly bias according to my own
personal preferences.

## Front End

I particularly enjoy front-end web development because it allows me to
operate simultaneously as a developer, designer, and product manager.

### Tool of Choice: React

React is great framework to learn just because of it's enormous
popularity. However, I've found that once you get through the horrific
uphil battle of learning how to <i>think in react</i>, it's built-in
composability makes constructing complex single-page applications an
absolute delight.

Other Tools: I've used [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) sparingly at hackathons.
Less experience with [Angular](https://angular.io/).
