> I recently listened to [The Mom Test](https://www.amazon.com/Mom-Test-Customers-Business-Everyone-dp-B07RJZKZ7F/dp/B07RJZKZ7F/ref=mt_audio_download?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=#customerReviews) and loved it so much I decided to take and share my notes. I highly suggest you give it a read if you're working on an app. My own summary follows.

Even with an explosion of startup advice being generated lately, most of which instructing founders to "talk to customers", founders still find themselves struggling to ask the right questions and glean meaningful insights about what they're building.

Some ask questions that are too heavy, like "do you think this is a good idea?", while other tip-toe around portions of their business they have less certainty about, thus inspring only positive affirmations of their product, similar to the feedback their mothers would give (thus inspiring the name of the book).
