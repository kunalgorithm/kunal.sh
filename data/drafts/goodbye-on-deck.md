I'm thrilled to announce I'm transitioning out of my full-time role as a software engineer at [On Deck](https://beondeck.com). I'm not parting ways entirely, however, because I'm participating in the upcoming Third On Deck Fellowship this march as a fellow and hacker-in-residence.

My time at On Deck has been more constructive, challenging, tumultuous, growth-inducing, and fun than I ever could have imagined. When I came on board, the company was in it's most nascent phase. Though On Deck events had been going on throughout the world for several years, it was only a couple months before I joined that On Deck became a company. By raising money and assembling a team, we were rocket-fueling our ambitions to, in the words of our CEO David Booth, be the _first place the best talent looks when thinking about starting or joining a startup_.

To serve our goal, we assembled a product team, Julian Weisser, Emma Salinas and myself to build [Via](https://via.beondeck.com), a referral-based hiring platform to introduce talent to startups _via_ investors.
