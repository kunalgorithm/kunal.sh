I find using [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/about) for invaluable when learning chinese vocabulary, and even moreso the ability to embed pronunciations in my flashcards.

However, the popular library [Chinese Support Redux](https://github.com/luoliyan/chinese-support-redux) has recently found itself without a maintainer and is consequently quite tricky to set up. Here's how I did it.

### Specifications

- macOS Big Sur 11.1
- Anki Version 2.1.41

### Steps

1. Delete the plugin from Anki add-ons
2. Download and unzip [this](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS) repo.
3. Drag the `chinese` directory from folder into the your Anki `addons21` folder (for me, this is `/Users/kunal/Library/Application Support/Anki2/addons21`)
4. Rename it to `1128979221`, the original addon code.
5. Restart Anki and follow the original [usage](https://github.com/luoliyan/chinese-support-redux#usage) instructions to create and auto-populate cards.
