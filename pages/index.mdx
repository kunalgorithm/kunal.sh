# Hey, I'm Kunal Shah ðŸ‘‹

<SocialIcons />

I'm currently Head of Engineering at [On Deck](https://beondeck.com), where I'm leading the development of [Cosign](https://cosign.co), a peer-to-peer credentialing network, and [Via](https://via.beondeck.com), a referral-based hiring platform.

On the side, I'm working on [graphql-fullstack](https://github.com/kunalgorithm/graphql-fullstack).

You can reach me at [me@kunal.sh](mailto:me@kunal.sh).
