# Hey, I'm Kunal

<SocialIcons />

I'm a developer and predominantly interested in prototyping web applications. I'm currently working on [Via](https://via.beondeck.com) at [On Deck](https://beondeck.com).

On the side, I'm working on [Snailsheet](https://snailsheet.com) and [graphql-fullstack](https://github.com/kunalgorithm/graphql-fullstack).

You can reach me at [me@kunal.sh](mailto:me@kunal.sh).
