I built and styled this site by following the official [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) and you can find the source code in it's entirety on [github](https://github.com/kunalgorithm/kunal.sh).

My previous site was built with [`nextjs-mdx-blog-kit`](https://github.com/lorenseanstewart/nextjs-mdx-blog-kit), which allowed embedding react components within markdown posts using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com). Although this was wonderfully expressive, I found that being bale to context switch between writing and coding compelled me to spend far more time context switching between the two than actually focusing on either one. Consequently, I turned to pure markdown for my writing.

I also considered Wordpress, Ghost, Contentful, Medium, and other content management systems; primarily because they'd be further conducive to focus, but ultimately decided against giving up granualar control of my content and the build process, and severing my understanding of what was powering my website under the hood. Gatsby served as the ideal balance between the two.
