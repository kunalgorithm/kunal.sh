Last month marked a full year of living in San Francisco, and I feel merits a reflective blog post on how things have been.

The last year has been extraordinary, in more ways than I can describe.

I spent the last 6 months of 2018 wandering around south east asia in an attempt to better collect myself before I began my career full-time, and to be more deliberate in my approach. In college, I felt like I always had too much to do to take the time to reflect properly on what I wanted to do with myself. In Asia, it was the opposite. I had entire days to fill, and nothing to fill it with.

The first thing is that "stuff" gets old. A common conceptualization of happiness is that "if only I had X, I would be happy". Now substitute X for food/vacations/exotic food/great views/temples/experiences/parties/nightclubs/etc and give yourself unlimited time to indulge themselves and you'll come face to face with the reality of hedonic adaptation: the psychological principle that explains the more "stuff" you get, the more you expect, and all the while your satisfaction levels remain stagnant.

I believe this applies to every form of X. There is no meal, place, vacation, or experience that will not grow old. Here is the curse of having a mind that perpetually seeks distraction and pleasure.

The escape, I learned, was rooted in eastern wisdom: Buddhism in particular. The doctrine of buddhism dictates that life itself is suffering, and that suffering originates in desire. Thereby, the end of desire will be the end of suffering. So, it's possible to arrive at more consistent forms of contentment by giving up the traditional chase for happiness, success, riches, or anything else.

I realized that this was a perspective that still could be compatible with an expectation to be a productive member of society, if I could find work that was interesting enough to be worth doing for its own sake, and the productive of which was useful enough to society for me to be remunerated for it.

The obvious answer here was programming.

Writing code is fulfilling for a number of reasons: 1. Nothing is redundant, and thereby boring, pretty much by definition. 2. it's all just a series of complex puzzles. 3. the end result is a tangible product that you can show people. Often times people find what you've built useful, which compounds an external motivational facet onto the inherent interestingness of writing code.

Now, I just needed to get good enough at it for me to get a job doing it.

So, I took a bunch of online classes on Coursera, Udemy, etc, and incrementally taught myself javascript, react, typescript, node, and graphql while travelling; and built up a short portfolio of side projects. I began to realize, however, that to take my skills to the next level I'd have to work on larger codebases with other engineers. I felt a startup would be the best place to do this since I could be able to take ownership of a large portion of a codebase, even as an engineer with little experience.

The opportunity arose when a friend posted on facebook that the startup he was working at in San Francisco, TrustedFor, was hiring a javascript engineer. I jump at the opportunity and got it touch. After a short call with the CEO, the only existing engineer at the company, and a short technical interview, they invited me to join their company in SF.

I wasn't expecting this, and explained that I didn't expect to have the opportunity to wander the planet on a long term basis again anytime soon, and would like to travel for a while longer before returning to the US. Shockingly, they were ok with this and I started to work for them remotely.

Working on a large and foreign codebase was hard. There were so many moving parts that plugged into other moving parts, and I couldn't shake the feeling that if I made one wrong move and pushed buggy code, the entire app would implode and it would be on me. That, and there was as drastic of a time difference between me and the team as could physically be possible.

Not to mention, I was accustomed to nobody using or viewing the code I had previously been writing for my side projects, and whenever I got stuck, had gotten into the habit of just saying "fuck it" and committing the broken code, resolving to fix it some later time or abandoning that particular project entirely and starting from scratch.

This was absolutely unacceptable within a startup. Pushing broken code essentially meant pushing the expectation to another engineer (the CEO) to fix my sloppy implementation, thus offloading the responsibility for my own work. I quickly learned that not only make our application unreliable to use, but it was also a dick move. I learned that lesson quickly.
