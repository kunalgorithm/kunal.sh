This is what I'm up to at the moment. If you have your own website, you should [create one too](https://nownownow.com/about).

- Building [Compose](https://compose.pw/), an AI-powered email writer.
- Helping founders build prototypes as a [hacker-in-residence](./odf) at [On Deck](https://beondeck.com).
- Improving my [first tutorial](./posts/building-a-fullstack-twitter-clone).
- Building [Mindstreaks], a meditation app, with [Patricia](https://twitter.com/_patriciamou).

### Eager to discuss

- Applications and limitations of [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165).
- GraphQL vs REST, particularly tooling and usage with SSR.
- The relationships between empathy, deliberate reasoning, and moral judgement.

### Reading
