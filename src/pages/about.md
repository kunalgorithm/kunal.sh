<!-- ![profile](/profile.jpeg) -->

I'm currently Head of Engineering at [On Deck](https://beondeck.com), where I'm leading the development of [Cosign](https://cosign.co), a peer-to-peer credentialing network, and [Via](https://via.beondeck.com), a referral-based hiring platform.

On the side, I'm working on [graphql-fullstack](https://github.com/kunalgorithm/graphql-fullstack), a web app boilerplate that allows you to deploy a preconfigured feature-robust app in under a minute, so you can focus on shipping features instead of choosing or wiring together a tech stack.

Previously, I was a member of [South Park Commons](https://southparkcommons.com), where I worked at [Trustedfor](https://trustedfor.com) and led the developent of the web platform.

I studied computer science at Rice University, where I founded the the [Rice Blockchain Club](https://blockchain.rice.edu/), ran division 1 track and field, and served as the webmaster of [Wiess College](https://teamwiess.com).
