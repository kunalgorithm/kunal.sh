Hi, I'm Kunal ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on [graphql-fullstack](https://github.com/kunalgorithm/graphql-fullstack), a web app boilerplate that allows you to deploy a preconfigured feature-robust app in under a minute, so you can focus on shipping features instead of choosing or wiring together a tech stack.

Most recently, I built [Cosign](https://cosign.co), a peer-to-peer credentialing network, and [Via](https://via.beondeck.com), a referral-based hiring platform, at [On Deck](https://beondeck.com)

Previously, I worked on [Trustedfor](https://trustedfor.com) at [South Park Commons](https://southparkcommons.com).

I studied computer science at Rice University, where I founded the [Rice Blockchain Club](https://blockchain.rice.edu/), competed on the NCAA division-1 track team, and served as the webmaster of [Wiess College](https://teamwiess.com).

You can reach me at [me@kunal.sh](mailto:me@kunal.sh).
