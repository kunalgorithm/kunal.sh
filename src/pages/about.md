Hi, I'm Kunal ðŸ‘‹

I like turning complicated problems into simple and intuitive solutions.

Most recently, I built [Cosign](https://cosign.co), a peer-to-peer credentialing network, and [Via](https://via.beondeck.com), a referral-based hiring platform, at [On Deck](https://beondeck.com)

Previously, I helped build [Trustedfor](https://trustedfor.com) at [South Park Commons](https://southparkcommons.com).

I attended Rice University, where I helped start [Rice Blockchain](https://blockchain.rice.edu/), served as webmaster of [Wiess College](https://teamwiess.com), and competed on the NCAA D1 track team.

You can reach me at [me@kunal.sh](mailto:me@kunal.sh).
