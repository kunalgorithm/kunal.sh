Hi, I'm Kunal ðŸ‘‹

I'm a JavaScript engineer and I create tools for the web.

Most recently, I helped build [Market X](https://www.marketxventures.com/), [Interval](https://interval.com), [Found](https://found.so), and [Secureframe](https://secureframe.com).

Previously, I built [Cosign](https://cosign.co), a peer-to-peer credentialing network, and [Via](https://via.beondeck.com), a referral-based hiring platform, at [On Deck](https://beondeck.com). Prior to that, I helped create [Trustedfor](https://trustedfor.com) at [South Park Commons](https://southparkcommons.com).

I attended Rice University, where I studied computer science, helped start [Rice Blockchain](https://blockchain.rice.edu/), served as webmaster of [Wiess College](https://teamwiess.com), and competed on the NCAA D1 track team.

You can reach me at [kunal@compose.ai](mailto:kunal@compose.ai).
